      I am picking IEM Rio Major 2022 as my first favorite tournament in CS:GO.
      The major took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from November 5th to 13th.
      24 Teams all around the world take a participation in the tournament and
      only one team had a chance to win the major with a prize pool of
      $1,250,000. The reason why I am choosing this tournament is because my
      favorite team won the tournament, "Outsiders". The next reason is the
      crowd, Brazilian fans are just amazing. The team won $500,000 and 2
      invitations to BLAST Premier World Final 2022 and IEM Katowice 2023. Below
      is a link to the tournament page in HLTV.

      The next tournament that I am going to talk about is Starladder Major
      Berlin 2019. The major took a place in 2019 in Berlin. The tournament was
      in between August 28th to September 8th. The reason why I am placing the
      tournament to the second place is simple. My favorite team at that time,
      "Avangar" reached the playoffs and were in finals, but they lost in finals
      to Danish "Astralis". Even though "Avangar" lost in the finals, I was
      super happy at that time. Because young, not experienced boys 3 from
      Kazakhstan and 2 from Russia and Uzbekistan reached the major finals.

    <p>
      The last tournmanent that I am going to mention about is Blast Pro Series
      Moscow 2019. This is my another favorite tournament because my favorite
      team "Avangar" won their first ever big trophy. They earned $125,000 for
      their first place and this was an incredible run for them in this
      tournament.

    <h4 style="text-align: center">My favorite team</h4>
    <p>
      Let me briefly introduce you with my favorite team in CS:GO. I started
      watching the game from the beginning of 2019. At that time, I followed
      young guys from Kazakhstan, presenting team <b>"Avangar"</b>. After an
      incredible run at the Berlin major and Blast, "Virtus.pro" bought the
      team. In "Virtus.Pro" they did not achieve high results but won a
      "Flashpoint 2" tournament and $500,000. As Russia started a war and all
      Russian organizations are banned at the pro scene, the team had to perform
      as a different team, not pretending a Russian organization. So, they
      became "Outsiders". But everyone who are watching the pro scene knows that
      "Outsiders" are in reality "Virtus.Pro".
